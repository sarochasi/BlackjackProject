# BlackjackProject

### Overview

This project is a command-line Blackjack game implemented in Java. The game follows standard Blackjack rules where a player competes against a dealer to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over. The game includes shuffling, dealing cards, and decision-making for both the player and the dealer.

### Features

* Deck of Cards: A full deck of 52 cards is created, shuffled, and used for dealing.
* Player and Dealer Hands: Both player and dealer have their own hands, and cards are dealt according to Blackjack rules.
* Blackjack and Bust detection: The game detects and announces Blackjack (a hand value 0f 21) and busts (a hand value over 21).
* Winner determination: The game determines the winner based on the final hand value.
* Flexible Ace value: Aces can count as either 1 or 11.

### Technologies Used

* Java
* Object-Oriented programming
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Git
* GitHub

## Lessons Learned

* Object-Oriented program: This project enforced the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
* Game Logic Implementation: Handling game rules and state transitions.
* Java Collections: Working with Java's Collections Framework (such as 'ArrayList') for managing game data efficiently.
